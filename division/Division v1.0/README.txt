FAQ:
* How to create thumbnails
With the built-in theme functions you have two options to create thumbnails:
1. Auto thumbnail creation:
If you would like to create thumbnails for homepage and archive pages, just simply upload an image and insert to the post,
the thumbnail will be automatically created, no custom fields needed.

2. Custom field for thumbnail creation:
If you would like to create thumbnails via custom field instead of auto-creation, just simply add a custom field to the post:
Custom field name: thumb
Custom field value: IMAGE LINK (i.e. http://www.yoursite.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sample.jpg)
